It'
s me
mr guy
okay lemme write something:

It is a nice day for me to exist, would you not say?
This is why I do exist.
If it wasn't for me existing, you would be dead. Simple as.
Allow me to rewind time...

It was a rainy day in Springville, Massachussets or whatever
then I hear a noise!
It weas loud, so I investigated

I discovered the truth! 
It was I, doing your mom!

That was when it happened, and the miracle of life occured. 
Inside your mom.

THen nine months later, out you came.
Anyway then I went to get some milk and here I am fifteen years later.

So what's up champt?
