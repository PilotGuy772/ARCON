This is the Alfalite Research, Control, and Operations Network for starships. This system is intended to fully operate a starship with more functionality, precision, and features than a regular human crew.

This shell has [CREW] level control. Various starship systems may be monitored and some can be changed but and [ADMIN] level user is required for some operations.

The ARCON shell also features functionality for file directory editing, file reading/writing, and other basic system functions.

{INSTRUCTIONS}

This is a console application, meaning that you must interact using a command-line interface. To interact with the system, send commands. Here is a list of all essential commands:

FILE SYSTEM COMMANDS:

cd      - change or display the current working directory (CDW)
ls      - list all items in the CWD
mkdir   - create a new folder in the CWD
concat  - create a new file with the given extension in the CWD
open    - blanket command for all file editing Allows for 
            read   - lists, line by line, all content of the directed file
            edit   - interactive line-by-line editor for an entire file
            delete - deletes the directed file from the system. If it is a file essential to operation, like this file (info.txt) for example, it will be restored on next startup. 

USER COMMANDS:

login   - input a username and password of an existing user
newacc  - create a new account with a username and password

Arguments are placed after the command in this format:

CMD [{essential args}, (optional args)]

open example.txt edit
